# README

Accordion is a small project for iOS that implements file navigation using accordions. 
Accordion aims to be a persistent layer between your TableView and your files on the storage and hopefully become an alternative to tipical drill-down navigation (like UINavigationController) for files.


Accordion is under MIT Licence so if you find it helpful  just use it :D

###**Accordion1:**

Is the very first implementation, left for historical purposes :)

###**Accordion2:**

Is the version I am working on, is much better but still lacking of some features, I hope I can have full version by the end of June or beggining of July 2011.
